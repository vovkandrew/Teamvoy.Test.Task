"# Teamvoy_test_task" 
Create a rest controller for creating orders in storage (any storage can be used).
The order has three fields: price, quantity, item (please chose any three).
The order is valid for 10 minutes (not valid orders can be deleted).
Create another rest controller which will return the requested item at the lowest price (the number of items must be reduced in storage). If there are not enough items, return all available.

Requirements
Please write code using Java 11 and Spring Boot, also create tests to cover the main logic.
You can upload the source code on any public repository.

Expected Result
Bugs free source code with the full-implemented requirements

To run the app, simply fork the project and run TeamvoyApplication class
